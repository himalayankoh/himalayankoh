  { title: 'Checkout Options', body: 'You do not need an account to buy from Himalayan Koh. Guest checkout collects only what is needed to process, ship, and support the order. If you create an account instead, we keep your order history, profile details and saved information so you can track current and past orders. Either way, the information is collected, stored and protected under this policy.' },
  { title: 'How We Use Your Information', body: 'To process and fulfill orders, communicate regarding orders and customer service, respond to inquiries, improve our website, prevent fraud, comply with legal obligations, and send promotional emails if you have opted in.' },
  { title: 'Cookies and Analytics', body: 'Our website uses essential browser storage for the cart, account sessions, and preferences. With your consent, we may load Google Analytics and Google advertising technologies, including AdSense, to measure traffic and show relevant ads. Google and its partners may use cookies or similar technologies and may use information such as device, browser, and interaction data as described in Google\'s own policies. Our site sends Google consent signals (Consent Mode) covering advertising storage, advertising personalization, advertising measurement, and analytics storage; they remain denied until you accept, and Google is instructed not to read or write advertising cookies while they are denied. You can decline optional analytics and advertising through the consent prompt, change your decision by clearing this site\'s storage in your browser, or use Google\'s advertising settings (https://adssettings.google.com) to control the ads Google shows you; see our choices section for more information. Where required by law, including in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, we use a consent solution compatible with Google\'s certification requirements for advertising partners before personalized advertising runs.' },
  { title: 'Sharing Your Information', body: 'We do not sell or rent your personal information. We share only with trusted service providers including payment processors, shipping carriers, website hosting, analytics, and AI service providers that help operate support tools.' },
  { title: 'Data Security', body: 'We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. While no method of transmission is completely secure, we strive to use industry-standard practices.' },

Google (including AdSense) is an advertising vendor on this site, and third-party vendors, including Google, may use cookies or similar identifiers to serve ads based on your prior visits to this website or other websites. Those vendors may collect device, browser, and interaction data for ad delivery, measurement, and fraud prevention. Advertising may be personalized or non-personalized depending on your consent and your region, and where consent is required it is collected before personalized advertising runs. You can control personalized advertising from Google in your Google Ads Settings (https://adssettings.google.com), and you can review how Google uses information from sites that use its services at Google\'s Partner Sites Privacy Policy (https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites). Turning off personalized advertising does not remove ads; it makes them less relevant to you.' },
  { title: 'Your US Privacy Rights', body: 'If you live in a US state with a comprehensive privacy law, including California, you have the right to know what personal information we hold about you, to request a copy of it, to ask us to correct it, and to ask us to delete it. You also have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information: Himalayan Koh does not sell personal information and does not share it for cross-context behavioral advertising outside the consent choices described above. We will not discriminate against you for making a privacy request. To exercise any of these rights, email sales@himalayankoh.com from the address on the order, include the request and the order number if you have one, and we will respond within the timeframe the law allows.' },
  { title: 'Data Retention', body: 'Order, payment, and shipping records are kept for as long as needed to fulfil the order and then to meet accounting, tax, warranty, and dispute obligations. Support emails and contact-form messages are kept while the issue is open and for a reasonable period afterwards so we can recognise repeat problems. Analytics data is retained according to the settings of the provider we use. When information is no longer needed, we delete it or remove the details that identify you.' },
  { title: 'Payment Details', body: 'Card and bank details are entered on the payment provider\'s own secure checkout and are not stored on Himalayan Koh servers: we receive a confirmation that a payment succeeded, along with the transaction reference we need for refunds and accounting, not your full card number. Online payment processing is provided by a third-party payment processor when checkout is enabled. If payment is not enabled, checkout does not create a paid order and no payment is taken.' },
  { title: 'Email Marketing', body: 'If you opt in to newsletters or promotional messages, you can unsubscribe using the link in the message or by contacting us. Transactional messages about an order or a support request may still be sent when they are necessary.' },

  { title: 'Products, Pricing, and Availability', body: 'Product availability, pricing, images, specifications, and descriptions may change. We work to keep details accurate, but occasional errors may occur.' },
  { title: 'Orders and Payment', body: 'Submitting checkout is not acceptance of an order. An order is accepted only after the payment provider confirms a successful transaction and Himalayan Koh sends a confirmation. If payment is unavailable, the checkout action remains disabled and no paid order is created.' },
  { title: 'Customer Responsibilities', body: 'You are responsible for providing accurate contact, shipping and payment details, and for using any product according to the manufacturer\'s instructions, the product label, its warnings, and the law that applies where you are.' },
  { title: 'Shipping and Delivery', body: 'Shipping availability, cost, and estimated delivery windows are shown at checkout or on product pages. Estimates are not guarantees.' },

  { title: 'Product Information', body: 'Product information is for general shopping purposes. Follow the product label, instructions, warnings and any applicable requirement, and stop using a product that appears unsafe or causes harm; contact an appropriately qualified professional when that happens. Animal food and feed: Himalayan Koh does not manufacture or independently certify animal food, feed, treats, supplements or salt/mineral products. Check the label, ingredients, intended species, warnings, lot and expiry information, supplier reference, and destination support before use, and do not use animal products as human food.' },
  { title: 'Disclaimers and Liability', body: 'The website and its content are provided without warranties beyond those that cannot legally be excluded. Himalayan Koh is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential losses except where liability cannot be limited.' },
  { title: 'Order Acceptance and Cancellation', body: 'We may decline or cancel an order if an item is out of stock, if a price or product detail was listed in error, if payment cannot be verified, or if the delivery address cannot be served. If we cancel an order after payment, the amount charged for that order is refunded to the original payment method. You may ask us to cancel an order before it ships by emailing sales@himalayankoh.com with the order number; once a shipment is with the carrier, the returns process applies instead.' },

We may restrict access where activity risks other customers, our suppliers, or the store itself.' },
  { title: 'Warranties and Product Limits', body: 'Products are supplied with the documentation and packaging the manufacturer provides. We do not add a warranty beyond the rights you have under applicable consumer law, and we do not warrant an outcome from using a product, because results depend on the animal, the environment, and how the item is used and maintained. Follow the label, the size or species guidance, and any capacity limit stated in the listing.' },
  { title: 'Governing Law', body: 'Himalayan Koh is operated from Houston, Texas, United States. These Terms of Service and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas and applicable federal law of the United States, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision. Any dispute should first be raised with us at sales@himalayankoh.com so we can try to resolve it directly.' },
  { title: 'Changes and Contact', body: 'We may update these Terms by posting a revised version with a new date. Continued use of the site after an update means the revised Terms apply. If any part of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining parts continue to apply. Questions about an order, a return, or these Terms: email sales@himalayankoh.com or call (832) 224-6466, Monday to Friday, 9AM–6PM CT.' },

  { title: 'Return Eligibility', body: 'Return requests must be made within 30 days of delivery. Products must be in their original packaging with all included parts and accessories. Items opened solely for reasonable inspection remain eligible if found to be defective or damaged upon arrival. Returns need prior approval from Himalayan Koh before they are shipped back, so please contact us first.' },

Himalayan Koh is operated from 12620 FM 1960 W Ste A-4, Houston, TX 77065, United States.' },
  { title: 'Where We Ship', body: 'Himalayan Koh offers shipping within the United States where the destination is supported by the product, supplier, and carrier. International shipping is not currently offered.' },
  { title: 'Shipping Costs', body: 'Shipping cost is calculated for your specific cart, products, and destination, and is shown in the cart and again at checkout before you pay. The amount displayed immediately before payment is the amount that applies to your order. Free shipping currently applies to qualifying orders of $50 or more, and to orders where every item in the cart is individually flagged as qualifying for free shipping. A promotion applies only as displayed in the cart or checkout, may have exclusions, and can change or end without notice; the threshold and the final charge are always confirmed before you pay.' },
  { title: 'Processing Time', body: 'Orders are prepared for dispatch once payment is confirmed. Because different products may be fulfilled from different supplier locations, preparation time can vary between items in the same order. You will receive shipment and tracking information when it becomes available.' },
  { title: 'Shipping Methods & Times', body: 'Shipping services and their delivery windows are quoted by the carriers for your own cart and destination, and are shown at checkout before you pay. We publish no delivery estimate of our own: where a carrier gives a transit time, that is the window shown for your order, and it is an estimate rather than a guarantee — your destination, the fulfilment location of each item, and carrier load all affect the final date. A faster service is offered only when the carrier lists one for your address at checkout.' },
  { title: 'Order Tracking', body: 'Once your order ships, you will receive a confirmation email with a tracking number that you can use on the carrier’s website. You can also check your order status at any time from your Himalayan Koh account.' },
  { title: 'Delivery Delays', body: 'Delays can occasionally occur because of high order volume, supplier or carrier issues, weather events, public holidays, or other circumstances outside our control. Delivery estimates can be affected by your destination, the fulfilment location of each item, and carrier load during peak periods. If your order is significantly delayed, contact us and we will investigate.' },
  { title: 'Missing or Lost Packages', body: 'If tracking shows "delivered" but you have not received your package, check with neighbours, building management, or your local post office. If you still cannot locate your package after 48 hours, contact sales@himalayankoh.com and we will work with the carrier to resolve it.' },
  { title: 'Address Accuracy', body: 'Please double-check your shipping address before completing checkout. Himalayan Koh is not responsible for orders shipped to an incorrect address provided by the customer. Address correction fees charged by carriers are the customer’s responsibility.' },
  { title: 'P.O. Boxes & Military Addresses', body: 'P.O. Box and APO/FPO/DPO destinations are supported where a carrier can deliver to them, and the available options are shown at checkout. Delivery times to military addresses may vary, and express services may not be available for these destinations.' },

Product pages and buyer guides are written from the manufacturer and supplier information available to us, from the item as listed, and from reputable published guidance where a source is relevant. A guide describes what to check before buying; it is not a laboratory result and it is not a guarantee of how a product will perform for your animal.' },

    { q: 'How does online checkout and payment work?', a: 'Orders are placed directly through our secure online checkout. We accept major payment methods supported by our third-party checkout provider with industry-standard encryption. If checkout is undergoing scheduled maintenance, your cart is preserved and our support team is available to help you complete your order.' },
    { q: 'What payment methods do you accept?', a: 'When a payment provider is connected, the options it supports appear at checkout and the card form is provided by that provider. The amount displayed immediately before you pay is the amount that applies to your order.' },
    { q: 'Is my payment information secure?', a: 'Card details are entered in the payment processor’s own secure form and never touch Himalayan Koh servers. Himalayan Koh does not store complete card numbers.' },
    { q: 'Can I cancel an order?', a: 'Orders can be canceled within 2 hours of placement. After that the order enters processing — email sales@himalayankoh.com as soon as possible and we will tell you where it stands.' },

  { category: 'Products & Quality', items: [
    { q: 'Do you sell pet food or animal feed?', a: 'Some listings may be animal food, feed, treats, seed, supplements, or mineral products. Review the product label, ingredients, intended species, warnings, and lot or expiry information before use. Do not use animal products as human food. For product-specific questions, follow the label or ask an appropriate qualified professional.' },
    { q: 'How do you select your products?', a: 'Every product goes through a curation process before it is listed. We consider quality, design, value, and the supplier information we hold; where a specification cannot be confirmed, the product page says so instead of stating it.' },
    { q: 'Are your products authentic?', a: 'We aim to source products from manufacturers and authorized distributors, and every item is reviewed before it is listed. If a listing cannot confirm a brand, size, or material, the product page says so.' },
    { q: 'Do you offer warranties?', a: 'Warranty coverage varies by product and manufacturer. Check the product description for specific details; our 30-day return policy covers general quality issues.' },

  { category: 'Account & Support', items: [
    { q: 'Do I need an account to shop?', a: 'No. You can browse, add items to the cart, and check out without creating an account — orders are placed with the email address you provide. Creating an account lets you view your order history and manage your profile.' },
    { q: 'How do I contact customer support?', a: 'Email sales@himalayankoh.com or call (832) 224-6466. Our support team is available Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 6 PM CT. We typically respond to emails within 24 hours.' },
