/**
 * Homepage and contact-page body copy — ONE source of truth.
 *
 * The worker pre-renders these exact strings into the crawl HTML
 * (`injectHomeBody` / `injectContactBody` in worker/seo-meta.ts) and the React
 * pages render the same module through src/components/SiteContent.tsx, so a
 * crawler and a visitor cannot be shown different content. This is the same
 * arrangement already used for product, category and policy copy.
 *
 * Ground rules for anything edited here:
 *  - Facts are mirrored from the policy modules (SHIPPING_SECTIONS,
 *    RETURNS_SECTIONS, PRIVACY_SECTIONS), from FAQ_DATA, or from what the
 *    catalogue actually lists. Where the store cannot evidence a detail
 *    (delivery window, carrier, handling time, certification), the copy says so
 *    instead of guessing.
 *  - Numbers are limited to ones the policy pages already publish: the 30-day
 *    return window, the 2-hour cancellation window, the 24-hour reply time and
 *    the Mon-Fri 9AM-6PM CT support hours.
 *  - No claim here may be wider than what the corresponding policy page says,
 *    because both are read by the same visitor.
 *  - The FAQ answers deliberately repeat wording that also appears in the
 *    policy pages or on the /faq page (the site-pages test pins the shared
 *    phrases), so the same question cannot be answered two different ways.
 *  - A FAQ answer never restates a section on its own page: a FAQ that repeats
 *    the surrounding copy is padding, not value.
